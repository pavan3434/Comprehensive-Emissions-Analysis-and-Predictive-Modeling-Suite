# Evaluating-Carbon-Footprints-an-In-Depth-Analysis
Key components of this suite include:
Data Preprocessing and Exploration:
Handles missing values and duplicates
Performs one-hot encoding for categorical variables
Visualizations:
Time series plot of total emissions over years with trend line
Donut chart for commodity distribution
Histograms with KDE for various emission types
Bar plot for top parent entity distribution
Machine Learning Models:
Implements multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, and Neural Networks
Uses pipelines for consistent preprocessing across models
Performs feature selection to focus on the most important predictors
Model Evaluation:
Calculates various metrics: MSE, MAE, R-squared, RMSE, Explained Variance
Implements cross-validation for robust performance estimation
Visualizes model performance comparisons
Feature Importance Analysis:
Extracts and visualizes feature importances from the best performing model
Residual Analysis:
Scatter plot of predicted vs actual values
Residual plot to check for patterns in errors
Distribution of residuals to assess normality
This suite provides a holistic approach to emissions data analysis, from initial exploration to predictive modeling. It's particularly useful for environmental scientists, data analysts, and policymakers working on emissions reduction strategies. The combination of visual and statistical analyses offers both intuitive understanding and rigorous quantitative insights into emissions patterns and their predictors.
